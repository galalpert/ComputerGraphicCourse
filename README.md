# Computer Graphics Project

I created this project with Daniel Glazman as part of the Computer Gaphics course
we took at University of Haifa during our BS.c in computer science.
The project was written in C++ and OpenGl. 
The progress, Images and part of the code can be seen in:
Assigment1Report, Assigment2Report and Assigment3Report.
